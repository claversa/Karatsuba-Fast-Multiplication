# Karatsuba-Fast-Multiplication
Multiplies large numbers using the Karatsuba Fast Multiplication Method
This algorithm overcomes the integer size restriction for arithmetic procedures by operating on the input as character pointer arrays.
It utilizes Karatsuba's algorithm which breaks down two large (base-10) integers supplied on the command-line for multiplication. It works by recursively retrieving values for 3 equations until the values are single digits.
This program works for numbers with digit counts up to 50,000 so definitely give it a try!
